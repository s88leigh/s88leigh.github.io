                I am passionate about delivering a great product with exceptional business experience to my clients.
                I collaborate with clients to learn their story, and use innovative thinking to help design a product 
                that they are excited about. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Before moving to New Hamshire, I studied at Drexel University where I received a BA in Marketing, which 
                I later used to help manage the family business we owned.  I subsequently applied it to my own business. 
                With my extensive business experience and artistic background, I have helped clients solve their challenges 
                and deliver exceptional results. 
                <br>
                <br>
                As an advocate of life-long learning and innovative thinking, I continuously keep an open mind and seek 
                new inspiration with an unjudged mindset.
