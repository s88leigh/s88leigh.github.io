          <p class="card-text">
            I am a caring and commited person who has an afinity for the arts, nature, and helping others. 
            For the past several years, I took some time off to invest in my children, but am looking to 
            make my return to the workplace with a new career path. Now that my children are more independant, 
            I have time to acquire the skill sets that I would need to pursue a career in web development. I have 
            kept my skills sharp by volunteering in my community and local school. I also work part-time 
            as a substitue teacher, as I am an advocate of life-long learning.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before moving to New Hamshire, I studied at Drexel University where I received a BA in Marketing, 
            which I later used to help manage our family business. I subsequently applied it to my own business.
            With my extensive business experience and artistic background, I have helped clients solve their 
            challenges and deliver exceptional results.
            <br>
            As a former business intrepreneur, I understand the importance of delivering great products 
            with exceptional customer service.  I have collaborated with clients to learn their story, 
            and use innovative design thinking to help design a product that they are excited about. 
            I am passionate about designing, and eager to contribute my artistic ability, business experience 
            and the skills I have gained through my web development course in the IT world.
